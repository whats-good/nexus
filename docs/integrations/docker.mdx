## Introduction
It's possible to run Nexus in a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/whatsgood/nexus/general), without needing to write a single line of code. This is possible thanks to the Nexus [environment variables](/key-concepts/environment-variables) that allow you to configure the Nexus instance.

## Docker Compose example

```yml
version: "3.8"

services:
  nexus:
    image: "whatsgood/nexus:latest"
    container_name: nexus
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    environment:
      - 'NEXUS_NODE_PROVIDERS=[{"name": "eth.public", "url":"https://eth.public-rpc.com", "chainId": 1}]'
      - 'NEXUS_CHAINS=[{"name": "mainnet", "chainId": 1, "blockTime": 15}]'
      - 'NEXUS_RELAY_FAILURE=["cycle-requests", 5]'
      - 'NEXUS_RELAY_ORDER=random'
```

## Interacting with the Nexus container

Run `docker-compose up` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file to start the Nexus container. You can now send requests to the Nexus server running in the container.
