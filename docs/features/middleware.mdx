{/* ## Introduction

Nexus `middleware` are functions that run before or after the request is relayed to the [Node Providers](/key-concepts/node-provider). They can be used to modify the request, validate the request, or add additional functionality to the server. Examples include [authentication](/features/authentication), [caching](/features/caching), and [rate limiting](/features/rate-limiting).
