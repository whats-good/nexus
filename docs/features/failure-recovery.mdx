## Request cycling

If you configure Nexus with multiple providers that support the same chain, Nexus will by default cycle requests between them. If a request to one provider fails, Nexus will try the next provider in the list. This is useful for load balancing and failover. You can configure this behavior through the `relayFailureConfig` parameter:

```typescript
const nexus = Nexus.create({
  nodeProviders: [NODE_PROVIDER.alchemy.build(process.env.ALCHEMY_KEY)],
  chains: [CHAIN.EthMainnet],
  relayFailureConfig: {
    kind: 'cycle-requests',
    maxAttempts: 3,
  },
});
```

## Disabling request cycling

If you don't want Nexus to cycle requests between providers, you can disable this behavior by setting `relayFailureConfig` to `failImmediately`:

```typescript
const nexus = Nexus.create({
  nodeProviders: [NODE_PROVIDER.alchemy.build(process.env.ALCHEMY_KEY)],
  chains: [CHAIN.EthMainnet],
  relayFailureConfig: {
    kind: 'fail-immediately',
  },
});
```
