## Built-in Providers

Nexus ships with a number of built-in node providers, and allows you to securely configure them to access any blockchain network. Connecting via a provider is as easy as the following:

```typescript
import {
  Nexus,
  CHAIN,
  NODE_PROVIDER,
} from "@whatsgood/nexus";

const nexus = Nexus.create({
  nodeProviders: [
    NODE_PROVIDER.alchemy.build(process.env.ALCHEMY_KEY),
    NODE_PROVIDER.infura.build(process.env.INFURA_KEY),
  ],
  chains: [CHAIN.EthMainnet],
});
```

In this example, we configure our Nexus proxy to use Alchemy and Infura as our node providers, and to connect to  Ethereum mainnet. The fact that these providers can connect to Ethereum is built-in to Nexus, along with several other popular networks.

## Creating a Custom Provider

Sometimes you may need to connect to a network that is not supported by the built-in providers. In this case, you can create a custom provider by building a `NodeProvider` object. This object is a simple configuration that tells Nexus how to connect to a network.

```typescript

export const ALCHEMY_NODE_PROVIDER = new NodeProviderBuilder("alchemy")
  .addChainSupport({
    kind: "key-appended-url",
    chain: CHAIN.BaseMainnet,
    baseURL: "https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2",
  })
  .addChainSupport({
    kind: "key-appended-url",
    chain: CHAIN.BaseSepolia,
    baseURL: "https://base-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2",
  })
  .build();

export const BASE_NODE_PROVIDER = new NodeProviderBuilder("base")
  .addChainSupport({
    kind: "pure-url",
    chain: CHAIN.BaseMainnet,
    url: "https://mainnet.base.org",
  })
  .addChainSupport({
    kind: "pure-url",
    chain: CHAIN.BaseSepolia,
    url: "https://sepolia.base.org",
  })
  .build();
```

Pay attention to how we used `key-appended-url` for alchemy, and `pure-url` for base. This is because Alchemy requires an API key to be appended to the URL, while Base does not. Nexus supports both kinds of providers, and allows you to inject keys at runtime through environment variables.
