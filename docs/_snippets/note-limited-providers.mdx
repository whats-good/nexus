<Note>
  `@whatsgood/nexus` is currently in pre-alpha and only ships with a handful of pre-configured chains and service providers. [Read more](/features/registry) to learn how to add your custom chains and providers. If you would like to extend the
  `default providers`, please [open an
  issue](https://github.com/whats-good/nexus/issues).
