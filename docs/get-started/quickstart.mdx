## Initialize the project

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm init @whatsgood/nexus
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm create @whatsgood/nexus
```
```bash yarn
yarn create @whatsgood/nexus
```
```bash bun
bun create @whatsgood/nexus
```
</CodeGroup>

This will prompt you to install the [@whatsgood/create-nexus](https://npmjs.com/package/@whatsgood/create-nexus) CLI tool. Press `y` to install it, and go through the project creation flow:

1. Name your project (e.g. `my-nexus-rpc`).
2. For this example, pick `express` as the target platform.
3. Confirm the project details and press `y` to create the project.

## Set environment variables

<Snippet file="note-limited-providers.mdx" />

1. <Snippet file="prerequisite-providers.mdx" />
2. Open the `.env` file that was created for you. 
3. Set a random string as the `NEXUS_GLOBAL_ACCESS_KEY` variable. This will be used to authenticate your requests to the Nexus RPC server.
4. Add your service provider keys to the file. We're using [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) as a placeholder example here, but you pick any provider you want. 

```bash .env
# Set your global access key here
NEXUS_GLOBAL_ACCESS_KEY=my-random-string
#                       ^ replace this with your own random string

# Add your service provider keys here
ALCHEMY_KEY=my-alchemy-key
#           ^ replace this with your own key
INFURA_KEY=
ANKR_KEY=
```

## Start the server

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm run dev
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm dev
```
```bash yarn
yarn dev
```
```bash bun
bun dev
```
</CodeGroup>

## Send a request

<Snippet file="send-a-request.mdx" />

You should see a response like: `{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "result": "0x11e3b03" }`
