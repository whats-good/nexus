{/* TODO: Add support for non-ethereum blockchains */}

`Nexus` is a simple, RPC proxy server for any [Ethereum JSON RPC](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/) compliant blockchain. Instead of connecting your dApps to a blockchain node, you can connect them to `Nexus` and `Nexus` serves the requests for you. `Nexus` is open source and free to use.

## Installation

The fastest way to get started with [@whatsgood/nexus](https://npmjs.org/package/@whatsgood/nexus) is to use our CLI. Check out our [Quickstart](/get-started/quickstart) guide to learn more.
