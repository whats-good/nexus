## Nexus overview

<Snippet file="warning-pre-alpha.mdx" />

`Nexus` is a simple, RPC reverse proxy server for any [Ethereum JSON RPC](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/) compliant blockchain. Instead of connecting your dApps to a blockchain node, you can connect them to `Nexus` and `Nexus` serves the requests for you. `Nexus` is open source and free to use.

## Features

`Nexus` is packed with powerful features that will help you build robust, scalable and secure dApps. Check out some of `Nexus`'s most powerful features below.
